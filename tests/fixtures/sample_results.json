    "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 vaccines have shown promising results in Phase 3 trials. This systematic review evaluates efficacy and safety across different vaccine platforms. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials published between January 2020 and December 2022. Results: 45 RCTs involving 2,142,857 participants were included. Vaccine efficacy ranged from 88% to 95% against symptomatic COVID-19. Safety profiles were generally favorable with most adverse events being mild to moderate. Conclusion: Available evidence supports the use of approved COVID-19 vaccines for prevention of symptomatic disease."

    "abstract": "The durability of immune response following COVID-19 vaccination remains a key question for public health decision-making. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating antibody persistence and cellular immunity following vaccination. Data from 127 studies with follow-up periods of 6-12 months showed gradual decline in neutralizing antibodies but maintained cellular immunity. Booster vaccination restored antibody levels to peak post-vaccination levels. These findings inform current recommendations for booster dose administration."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry and manufacturer websites up to October 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and test-negative designs evaluating any COVID-19 vaccine approved by a medicines regulatory authority. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We calculated vaccine effectiveness estimates using Bayesian random-effects models and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS: We identified 52 RCTs with 1,239,957 participants and 122 observational studies. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease in 85%-95% of vaccinated individuals."

    "abstract": "Following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, adaptive immune responses are critical for protection. We evaluated T cell responses in 87 vaccinated and 45 previously infected individuals. Both groups showed robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were stable over 6 months. Memory T cell populations were established and showed rapid proliferation upon antigen stimulation. These results demonstrate that mRNA vaccination induces durable cellular immunity."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While COVID-19 vaccines have excellent safety profiles overall, post-marketing surveillance has identified rare adverse events. METHODS: We conducted a pharmacovigilance analysis of adverse event reports in EudraVigilance (European Medicines Agency database) and VAERS (US Food and Drug Administration database) through December 2022. RESULTS: Among 9.8 billion vaccine doses administered globally, myocarditis (0.1-1 per 100,000), thrombotic thrombocytopenia (0.04-0.1 per 1 million) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (0.1-0.3 per 1 million) were identified as rare adverse events. The benefit-risk profile remains favorable compared to COVID-19 disease complications."
