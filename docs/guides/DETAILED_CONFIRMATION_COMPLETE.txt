DETAILED CONFIRMATION - COMPLETE
================================================================================

Date: December 18, 2025, 5:11 PM CET
Status: ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS CONFIRMED IN DETAIL
Action Needed: ⏳ YOUR CONFIRMATION TO PROCEED

================================================================================
WHAT I HAVE CONFIRMED
================================================================================

✅ CONFIRMATION 1: Develop Branch Workflow
  
  What I understand:
    • ALL future code changes go to 'develop' branch ONLY
    • Main branch remains stable and production-ready
    • Develop branch is for development and testing
    • Changes are isolated until ready to merge
    • Clear separation between development and production
  
  What I will do:
    • NEVER make code changes to main branch
    • ALL changes will be in develop branch
    • Every commit tagged clearly with type (Feature, Fix, etc.)
    • Clear documentation of what changed and why
  
  Status: ✅ UNDERSTOOD & CONFIRMED

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ CONFIRMATION 2: Versioning on All Code

  What I understand:
    • EVERY file starts with version number (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
    • Version format: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
    • CHANGELOG section in every file header
    • Date, Author, Description always included
    • Version increments with each change
  
  What I will do:
    • boolean_parser.py: v1.1.0 (field-term recognition added)
    • test_field_terms.py: v1.0.0 (new file)
    • Every file includes VERSION in header
    • Every file includes DATE created/modified
    • CHANGELOG tracks all versions and dates
    • Clear progression: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 → v1.2.0, etc.
  
  Status: ✅ UNDERSTOOD & CONFIRMED

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ CONFIRMATION 3: Detailed Comments for Laypeople

  What I understand:
    • Comments explain WHAT the code does, not just HOW it works technically
    • Assume reader has basic Python knowledge but NOT domain expertise
    • Explain WHY decisions were made
    • Include examples where helpful
    • No assumption of prior knowledge about Boolean parsers or field codes
    • Every function has detailed docstring with PURPOSE, EXAMPLES, etc.
  
  What I will do:
    • EVERY function has docstring
    • EVERY function explains: What it does, Why it matters, Examples
    • Code comments explain logic in plain language
    • "layperson" = someone without domain expertise
    • Include before/after examples
    • Explain the context and purpose
  
  Example I will provide:
    """
    Check if a token is a field-specific search term.
    
    WHAT THIS DOES:
    Recognizes patterns like "cancer"[MeSH] or 'tumor'[TIAB]
    
    WHY IT MATTERS:
    PubMed allows searching specific database fields
    
    EXAMPLES:
    >>> is_field_term('"cancer"[MeSH]')
    True
    """
  
  Status: ✅ UNDERSTOOD & CONFIRMED

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ CONFIRMATION 4: Files Always Available for Download

  What I understand:
    • EVERY code file is provided for download
    • NEVER embedded only in response text
    • File is downloadable document, not just mentioned
    • Ready to copy-paste directly into project
    • Clear, immediate access to code
  
  What I will do:
    • Use file creation tool for EVERY code file
    • Provide download link for EVERY file
    • Make content ready to copy-paste
    • Ensure file is not just text in response
    • Include file in downloadable format
    • Multiple formats if helpful (Python, JSON, etc.)
  
  Files you will receive:
    ├─ boolean_parser.py (DOWNLOAD ✓)
    ├─ test_field_terms.py (DOWNLOAD ✓)
    └─ implementation_guide.md (DOWNLOAD ✓)
  
  Status: ✅ UNDERSTOOD & CONFIRMED

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ CONFIRMATION 5: Directory Structure Always Specified

  What I understand:
    • EVERY file includes its full directory path
    • Format: "src/core/boolean_parser.py"
    • Unambiguous about WHERE to place the file
    • Consistent with existing project structure
    • Included in BOTH file header AND instructions
    • Never any confusion about placement
  
  What I will do:
    • Every file shows: DIRECTORY: src/core/
    • Every file shows: FULL PATH: src/core/boolean_parser.py
    • Every file shows: PLACEMENT: Add to existing file OR create new
    • Instructions always include directory
    • File header always includes directory
    • Multiple reminders of where to place each file
  
  Example structure I will use:
    # FILE: is_field_term_function.py
    # DIRECTORY: src/core/
    # FULL PATH: src/core/boolean_parser.py
    # (Content here)
    
    ## PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
    This code should be added to existing file at: src/core/boolean_parser.py
